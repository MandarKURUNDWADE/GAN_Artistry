## Build a Generative Adversarial Neural Network 🖼️🔍

### 📝 Description 
This project involves building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images of fashion items similar to the Fashion MNIST dataset. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator. The generator generates new images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images. They are trained in a way that the generator learns to generate realistic-looking images to fool the discriminator.

### 📊 Dataset 
The Fashion MNIST dataset is used for training the GAN. It consists of grayscale images of various fashion items like t-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.

### 🎯 Approach 
1. Import Dependencies and Data: Install required libraries and load the Fashion MNIST dataset.

2. Viz Data and Build Dataset: Visualize some sample images and preprocess the data by scaling the images.

3. Build Neural Network:
   - Build the Generator: Create a generator model that takes random values and generates images.
   - Build the Discriminator: Create a discriminator model that distinguishes between real and generated images.

4. Construct Training Loop:
   - Setup Losses and Optimizers: Define losses and optimizers for both the generator and discriminator.
   - Build Subclassed Model: Subclass the Model class to create a custom GAN model with training steps.
   - Build Callback: Create a custom callback to save generated images during training.
   - Train: Train the GAN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

5. Test Out the Generator:
   - Generate Images: Load the trained generator model and generate new fashion item images.
   - Save the Model: Save the trained generator and discriminator models for future use.

### 📥 Installations 
To run the code, you need to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command to install the dependencies:

```
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gpu matplotlib tensorflow-datasets
```

### ⚙️ Setup 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a compatible GPU with CUDA support (if using `tensorflow-gpu`).
3. Execute the "code-Notebook" to load the data, preprocess, build the GAN model, and start the training process.

### 🛠️Requirements 
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow-Datasets
- Matplotlib

### 🚀 Technology Used 
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### ▶️ Run
1. After setting up the environment and dependencies, run the "code-Notebook".
2. The script will start the training loop for the GAN on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
3. It will also save the generator and discriminator models after training.
4. The generated images will be saved in the "images" directory during the training process.
